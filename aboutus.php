                    <p>Past, present and future
                        Since the Lincln administration signed our national bank charter No. 24 in 1863, we’ve drawn on our
                        financial strength to serve customers. This has been especially evident in times of need, such as during the
                        COVID-19 pandemic. Our response by the end of 2020 included a $20 million premium pay program for our
                        employees, relief assistance and 108,000 Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
                        loans for our customers, and $30 million in expedited charitable contributions for our communities. As a
                        result, we’re proud to have been named the most essential bank amid the pandemic in a ranking by The Harris
                        Poll.</p>
